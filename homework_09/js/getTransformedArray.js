/*
Task #2
Write a function - getTransformedArray
It should accept array and function as arguments and returns new array with every element being transformed by that function
For example: 
function increment(num) { 
return num + 1;
} // just returns incremented number
getTransformedArray([1, 7, 20], increment); // -> [2, 8, 21]
Note: you should use your forEach function. Treat it as just an easy way to write your ordinary ‘for’ iterator, and the function you pass to it as just a body of that iterator.
